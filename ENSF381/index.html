      The <b>University of Calgary</b> (<i>U of C</i> or <i>UCalgary</i>) is a
      <b>public research university</b> located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
      The University of Calgary started in
      <b><u>1944</u></b> as the Calgary branch of the University of Alberta,
      founded in <b><u>1908</u></b>, prior to being instituted into a separate,
      autonomous university in <b><u>1966</u></b>. It is composed of <b><u>14</u></b> faculties
      and over <b><u>85</u></b> research institutes and centres. The main campus is located in
      the northwest quadrant of the city near the Bow River and a smaller south
      campus is located in the city centre. The main campus houses most of the
      research facilities and works with provincial and federal research and
      regulatory agencies, several of which are housed next to the campus such
      as the Geological Survey of Canada. The main campus covers approximately
      200 hectares (490 acres).

    <p>
      The University of Calgary was established in
      <b><u>1966</u></b>, but its roots date back more than half a century earlier
      to the establishment of the Normal School in Calgary in <b><u>1905</u></b>.
      The Alberta Normal School was established in Calgary to train primary and
      secondary school teachers in the new province. The Calgary Normal School
      was absorbed by the University of Alberta's Faculty of Education in
      <b><u>1945</u></b>, and operated as a part of its Calgary branch campus,
      a satellite campus of the University of Alberta. Operating from the west
      wing of the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art, the Calgary
      University Committee was formed <b><u>1946</u></b>, in an effort to lobby
      for separate permanent facilities for the branch campus.

    <p>
      In May <b><u>2001</u></b>, the University of Calgary tartan was accredited
      in a ceremony presided over by the president of the Scottish Tartans
      Society, and the director of the Register of All Publicly Known Tartans.
      The accreditation ceremony for the university's tartan was the first to
      take place in Canada. Use of the black, red, and gold tartan is limited
      to formal ceremonies, convocations, and a small number of items sold by
      the university. The tartan is also used by the university's pipe band.
